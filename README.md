# 🧠 Alzheimer's Risk Analysis

## 📋 Project Overview

This project investigates the prevalence and potential predictors of Alzheimer’s Disease using patient demographic and health data. The analysis identifies statistical relationships between diagnosis and attributes such as age, gender, MMSE scores, education level, and family medical history.

## 🔍 Objective

To explore how different demographic and health attributes relate to Alzheimer's diagnosis and identify early indicators using statistical and visual data analysis techniques.

## 🗂 Dataset Summary

- **Source**: Kaggle (Rabie El Kharoua)
- **Attributes Analyzed**:
  - Age (60–90 years)
  - Gender
  - Education Level (None to Higher)
  - Family History of Alzheimer’s
  - MMSE (Cognitive Function Score)
  - Diagnosis (Yes/No)

## 📊 Methods

- Descriptive statistics: Mean, median, standard deviation, skewness
- Visualizations: Histograms, box plots, bar charts, and density plots
- Comparative analysis of attributes vs. diagnosis

## 🔑 Key Findings

- **Age & MMSE**: Cognitive function (MMSE score) decreases with age.
- **Education**: Lower education levels are associated with higher Alzheimer’s diagnosis rates.
- **Gender**: Females had a higher rate of diagnosis in the dataset.
- **Family History**: Patients without a family history were more likely to be diagnosed, based on this sample.

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Small sample size may not reflect the wider population.
- Limited to a specific dataset with few features.
- Cannot be used as a diagnostic tool—only for exploratory purposes.

## 🔭 Future Work

- Expand dataset to include more health and lifestyle factors.
- Explore longitudinal or regional health patterns.
- Integrate medical history and environmental data for deeper insights.
